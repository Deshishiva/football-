Goal Shock Trader

Goal Shock Trader is a small prototype of a real-time, goal-reaction trading engine for football matches.

The core idea is simple: when a goal happens, the system checks whether the scoring team is the underdog. If an underdog scores and the market probability is still below 50%, the engine generates a simulated BUY signal. This is based on the assumption that prediction markets briefly lag after unexpected goals.

This project was built as part of the Omniverse Fund – AI/ML / Quant Intern assessment. It is not meant to be a full trading bot, but a clean demonstration of event-driven system design and trading decision logic.

What the Engine Does:

Listens to football goal events (live or mock)

Normalizes incoming data into a consistent format

Maps each match to a synthetic in-play market

Fetches the current market probability

Checks if the scoring team is an underdog

Executes a simulated BUY when conditions are met

Logs all decisions clearly in the terminal

Workflow Overview

A goal event is received from a feed

The event is normalized into a standard structure

The match is mapped to a market ID

The current market probability is retrieved

The trader checks:

Did the underdog score?

Is probability below 0.50?

Is the goal minute within limits?

If yes, a simulated BUY order is executed

How to Run:
Install dependencies
pip install websocket-client requests

Run the engine:
python main.py


The engine will start immediately and print goal events and trade decisions in real time.

Example Output:
EVENT: Juventus_Inter | Score: (1, 1) | Minute: 33
RESULT: BUY | market=MKT_Juventus_Inter | price=0.33 | size=20

EVENT: Arsenal_Chelsea | Score: (0, 1)
RESULT: NO TRADE | reason=high_prob

Notes:

Requires no paid APIs to run

Falls back to mock data automatically if live feeds are not provided

Designed to be easily extended with real exchanges and market data
