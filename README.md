Goal Shock Trader

This project is a small prototype of a goal-reaction trading engine.
The idea is simple: when a football match goal happens, the system checks if the scoring team is the underdog. If yes, it triggers a simulated “BUY” signal, based on the assumption that real markets (like Kalshi or Polymarket) briefly lag right after a surprising goal.

This was built as part of the Omniverse Fund – AI/ML / Quant Intern assessment.
The goal wasn’t to build a full exchange bot, but to demonstrate:

event-driven program design
real-time data handling
market-mapping logic
basic trading decision rules
clean modular Python structure
What the Engine Does
Here’s the high-level flow:
A mock feed generates random football goals (instead of using a paid API).
Every event goes through a normalizer so the structure is always consistent.
The matcher assigns the goal to a synthetic market (ex: Juventus_Inter → MKT_Juventus_Inter).
A mock price feed gives a temporary market price (simulating price lag).
The trader checks:
Was the scoring team the underdog?
Is the price still mispriced (< 0.50)?
If yes → it logs a BUY trade.
Everything is logged cleanly to the terminal.
The engine is completely modular, so any part can later be replaced with a real API.

How to Run the Project:

Install the only dependency:

pip install websocket-client

Run the engine:

python main.py


You will start seeing real-time goal events like:

EVENT: Juventus_Inter (1–1) | Scorer: Juventus
Underdog scored → BUY | Price=0.33 | Size=20


This runs the system end-to-end using only local Python files — no external APIs are required.

Folder Structure:
main.py            → entry point
mock_feed.py       → generates goal events
normalizer.py      → cleans/standardizes event
matcher.py         → assigns markets + probabilities
market.py          → small helper class
price_feed.py      → returns a simulated market price
trader.py          → decision engine (BUY / NO TRADE)
config.py          → basic settings
utils.py           → logger helper
index.html         → submission webpage (for Omniverse)
logs/              → output logs
README.md          → project documentation

Sample Output:

Below is an actual output from one of the test runs:

Goal: Juventus 1-1 Inter | Juventus
EVENT RECEIVED: Juventus_Inter | Score: (1,1)
Trader: Underdog scored → BUY
Order executed | market=MKT_Juventus_Inter | size=20 | price=0.33


Another case where the trader does not buy:

Goal: Arsenal 0-1 Chelsea | Chelsea
Trader: No trade | favorite scored | price=0.61
